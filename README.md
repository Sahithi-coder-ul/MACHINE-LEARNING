##DESCRIPTION:

I developed a predictive machine learning model using the scikit-learn library. The primary goal was to build a classifier that could predict outcomes from a dataset—my chosen project was spam email detection.

I began by importing and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. I experimented with multiple classifiers including Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, evaluating their accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

The entire implementation and evaluation process was documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which served as the final deliverable. This task significantly enhanced my understanding of the machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing and model training to performance evaluation and result interpretation.

Through this experience, I gained hands-on proficiency in practical ML concepts and tools that are highly relevant for real-world problem solving.
